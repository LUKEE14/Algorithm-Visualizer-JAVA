# Algorithm Visualizer

  Algorithm Visualizer is a simple and interactive tool developed in Java using the Swing framework. This project allows users to visualize the workings of common sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort. The visualizer provides a minimalistic and user-friendly interface, making it easy to visualize how each sorting algorithm processes data step by step.

## Features

  Visualization of Sorting Algorithms:

  Bubble Sort: Watch how the algorithm compares and swaps adjacent elements to sort the array.

  Merge Sort: Observe the divide-and-conquer approach, where the array is split and merged back in sorted order.

  Insertion Sort: See how the algorithm builds the sorted array one element at a time.

  Selection Sort: View how the algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
  
  Minimal Interface: The application features a clean and intuitive user interface, allowing users to focus on the algorithm's process without distractions.

## How To run ?

  Type these commands in terminal

  javac AlgorithmVisualizer.java

  java AlgorithmVisualizer

## Technologies Used

   Java: Core language used for developing the application. 
   Swing: Java's GUI toolkit for creating the visual interface.
